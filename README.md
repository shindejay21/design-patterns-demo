1. Decorator :
**Scenario:** Custom Coffee Ordering System. You are tasked with developing a coffee ordering system for a café. The café offers a base coffee (Espresso, Latte, etc.), and customers can customize it by adding options like milk, sugar, whipped cream, or caramel. Each of these additions increases the cost of the coffee. The system should calculate the final price of the coffee dynamically based on the customer's choices.

**Requirements:**
The base coffee has a fixed cost.
Additional toppings (like milk, sugar, etc.) should be added to the coffee dynamically, and their costs should be added to the base cost.
The system should be easily extendable to add new toppings in the future without modifying existing code.
